## Firebase Config (Do Not Commit)

The following files are excluded from version control for security reasons:

- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

To run the app, you must provide your own Firebase config files.  
Ask the maintainer or check the Firebase Console to download these.

Note: Copy `.example` files and rename them before adding real Firebase configs.

**⚠️ Never commit these files. They contain credentials.**
